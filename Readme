Siamese Neural Network for One-Shot Image Verification

Overview

This project implements a Siamese Neural Network (SNN) for one-shot image verification, inspired by the groundbreaking research in the paper "Siamese Neural Networks for One-Shot Learning" by Koch, Zemel, and Salakhutdinov (link to paper). This architecture is specifically designed to tackle the challenge of identifying whether two images are similar or dissimilar, even with limited training data. By leveraging the principles in the referenced paper, this project achieves impressive accuracy in image verification tasks.

How It Works

The core idea of the project revolves around feature extraction and comparison. The Siamese network architecture uses two identical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to process input images and generate their embeddings—unique numerical representations of the images. These embeddings are then compared using an L1 distance metric, which calculates the absolute difference between them. The resulting distance is passed to a sigmoid activation function, which outputs a similarity score ranging from 0 to 1.

Key Components:

Embedding Layer: A custom CNN-based feature extractor designed to capture critical visual features from input images. It consists of four convolutional layers, max pooling layers, and a fully connected dense layer to produce a 4096-dimensional embedding.

Distance Layer: A custom layer calculates the L1 distance between embeddings of the input and validation images, representing their similarity.

Sigmoid Classifier: Converts the computed distance into a probability score indicating whether the two images are a match.

Training the Model

The model was trained using the "Labeled Faces in the Wild" dataset. Positive, negative, and anchor images were used to create training pairs:

Positive Pairs: Consist of two images of the same individual.

Negative Pairs: Consist of two images of different individuals.

Training Process:

Data Preprocessing: Images were resized to 100x100 pixels, and pixel values were normalized to improve learning.

Model Optimization: Training used the binary crossentropy loss function and the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001.

Training Iterations: The model was trained for 50 epochs, with the dataset split into 70% training and 30% testing. Performance was monitored using precision and recall metrics.

Performance:

Accuracy: The model achieved a high recall of 71.43%, demonstrating its ability to identify similar pairs effectively. The precision metric (38.46%) highlights potential improvements for further iterations.

Reference to Research

This project is built on the ideas presented in the HEI paper "Siamese Neural Networks for One-Shot Learning." The paper’s insights into designing architectures that excel with limited data inspired the use of Siamese networks in this work. The embedding layers and L1 distance calculation directly align with the methodologies outlined in the research.
