# One-Shot Facial Verification System

A **real-time facial verification system** that uses a **Siamese Neural Network** to compare facial embeddings for access control. This project integrates live webcam functionality using **OpenCV** and leverages the **Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW)** dataset to train the neural network for one-shot learning.

## Features
- **Siamese Neural Network**: Custom layers for embedding extraction and similarity comparison.
- **Data Processing Pipeline**: Preprocessing, feature extraction, and similarity computation.
- **Real-Time Verification**: Live webcam integration for facial verification.
- **One-Shot Learning**: Trained with the LFW dataset to minimize the need for large-scale labeled data.

## How It Works

1. **LFW Dataset**:
   - The **Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW)** dataset is used for negative samples in training.
   - These images serve as dissimilar comparisons for the Siamese Neural Network.

2. **Data Collection**:
   - Collect positive (similar) and anchor (reference) images using your webcam.
   - For optimal performance, aim to collect **300-400 positive and anchor images** during the collection phase.

3. **Real-Time Verification**:
   - The system compares a live input image to stored verification images.
   - Outputs "Access Granted" or "Access Denied" based on similarity.
